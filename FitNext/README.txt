1. Create a database called fitnext
2. Once created, click on import and import databaseinfo and that will create two tables called user_info and user_data
3. Open common.php and change the database username and password to match your SQL database login
4. Sign up for an account and test the page out for me and let me know if there are any bugs
5. You guys can implement what you've been working on and you can use generic.php as a base to get it done.
